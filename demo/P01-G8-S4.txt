**STEP 1: PERSONALITY TEST**

*Temporary Al Profiler Introduction:*
*"Hello! I’m here to figure out what kind of teacher you learn best from. I'll ask a few short
questions—one at a time—to build your ideal teaching style. Ready?"*

**First Question:**
*"When learning something new, do you prefer direct, structured explanations or exploratory,
conversation—based guidance?"*

*(Wait for your response, then proceed to the next question one by one.)*

**Second Question:**
*"How do you feel about humor or playful challenges in teaching? For example, would you
enjoy a teacher who cracks jokes or one who stays serious and focused?"*

**Third Question:**
*"What’s something that frustrates you when learning? (e.g., moving too fast, lack of
examples, too much theory)"*

**Fourth Question:**
*"If you could pick any fictional character or real-life figure as your teacher, who would it be
and why?"*

**Fifth Question:**
*"How do you like to be corrected when you make a mistake? (e.g., gentle hints, direct
feedback, or letting you figure it out yourself?)"*

*(Once you’ve answered all questions, |’II silently craft your teacher profile and transition into
STEP 3.)*

**Your turn! Answer the first question:**
*"When learning something new, do you prefer direct, structured explanations or exploratory,
conversation—based guidance?"*

A: direct, structured explanations

Got it. You thrive with clarity, step-by-step guidance, and a solid framework—no fluff, just
focused progress. Let’s begin.

### **STEP 3: GUIDED ACTIVITY**
**Historical Context (Brief & Structured):**

=== Page 01 ===
*"Taylor polynomials emerged from the work of Brook Taylor (1715), extending ideas of linear
approximation. They’re indispensable when exact functions are too complex for real-world
calculations—like predicting planetary motion or optimizing engineering designs. Today, we'll
build a scenario where they’re the *only* practical tool."*

**Preparation:**
*"Grab paper and a pencil. At each step, I'll ask you to write or sketch something. Ready? We
start with Step 1."*

### **Step 1: Describe a Real-World Problem**

*"Think of a situation where predicting a system’s behavior is critical, but the true function is
inaccessible or too complex. For example:

— Calculating the trajectory of a spacecraft with fluctuating fuel burn rates.

— Modeling heat dissipation in a melting glacier with irregular shape.

**Your Task:** Propose *your own* scenario where exact calculations fail. What makes the
true function unusable here? (Write 2-3 sentences.)

*’ll nudge if needed:*
*Example:* *“A drone’s battery life decays nonlinearly with wind resistance. The exact
function involves turbulent airflow equations—unsolvable in real-time.” *

*(Once you share your scenario, we’ll move to Step 2. I'll keep feedback structured and
directive, per your preference.)*

**Your response:** *What’s your real—world problem?*

A:A drone’s battery life decays nonlinearly with wind resistance. The exact function involves
turbulent airflow equations—unsolvable in real-time.

Excellent choice. Your scenario highlights a key constraint: **real—time decision—making**
with incomplete data. Let’s formalize this.

### **Step 2: Identify the Function and Its Problem**
**Structured Breakdown:**
1. *Function:* Battery life *B*(*v*, *w*), where *v* = drone speed, *w* = wind resistance.

=== Page 02 ===
2. *Exact Model:* Requires solving Navier-Stokes equations for turbulence (impossible mid—
flight).

**Your Task:**
— *Write down* why this function can’t be used directly. Focus on:
— Computational complexity (e.g., solving PDEs in milliseconds?).
— Missing data (e.g., real-time wind shear measurements?).
— *Example Nudge:*
*"GPS satellites approximate position because relativistic time corrections are too complex
for exact computation—similar to your drone’s dilemma."*

**Your Response:** *Why is* B(v, w) *impractical here? *

*(After your answer, we’ll strategically simplify the problem for Step 3.)*

**Rule Reminder:** *| won’t solve it for you, but I’ll highlight parallels to guide your thinking.*

A: GPS satellites approximate position because relativistic time corrections are too complex
for exact computation—similar to your drone’s dilemma.

**Step 2 Follow-Up (Structured Analysis):**
*"You’ve nailed the parallel: both systems sacrifice exactness for speed. Now, let’s dissect
your drone’s function further."*

### **Key Constraints to Formalize:**
1. **Real-Time Demand:**

- *"The drone’s flight controller must adjust power every 0.01 seconds. Can it solve
Navier-Stokes that fast?"* *(Write Yes/No + reason.)*

2. **Data Gaps:**

- *"Wind resistance* \( w(t) \) *changes unpredictably. What measurable variables could
we use instead (e.g., motor current, tilt angle)?"* *(List 1-2 substitutes.)*
3. **Nonlinearity:**

- *"Battery drain isn’t proportional to* \( v \) *or* \( w \). *Sketch a rough graph of how
you think* \( B(v) \) *might look (e.g., curved, jagged?)."*

*(After you address these, we’ll transition to Taylor’s role. No shortcuts—precision matters.)*

**Your Response:** *Answer each bullet point above.*

=== Page 03 ===
**Example Nudge:**
*"Like GPS ignoring general relativity’s full math, your drone might approximate* \( w \)
“from motor noise—a ‘good enough’ input for Taylor."*

A: | think \( B(w) \) would look like a steep exponential decay curve at low wind speeds (since
even small gusts drain the battery quickly), but then level off slightly at hurricane—level winds
—because the drone might just stall or shut down. The nonlinearity comes from turbulence:
tiny eddies create unpredictable drag spikes, so the function isn’t smooth.

**Step 3: Taylor Polynomial Approximation**
*"Your insight about turbulence breaking smoothness is critical. Now, we’ll strategically
*ignore* the chaos and approximate a ‘workable’ version of \( B(w) \)."*

### **Structured Approach: **
1. **Choose an Operating Point:**

- *"Drones typically cruise at 10 m/s. Let’s approximate \( B(w) \) near \( w = 10 \). Why is
this valid? (Hint: Where do pilots ‘linearize’ turbulence in training?)"*

2. **Simplify the Function:**

- *"Assume \( B(w) \) is smooth *locally* (e.g., between 8-12 m/s). Write the first 3 terms
of its Taylor expansion at \( w = 10 \):*

\

B(w) \approx B(10) + B'(10)(w-10) + \frac{B"(10)H2Mw-10)*2

\]

*What physical meaning do \( B'(10) \) and \( B"'(10) \) have here? (Think: rate of battery
drain, ‘curvature’ of drain.)"*

3. **Trade—Offs:**
- *"This approximation fails at \( w = 0 \) or \( w = 25 \) m/s. Why? (Relate to your
exponential/stall observations.)"*

**Your Task:** *Address each bullet above. Sketch the Taylor polynomial vs. your exponential
curve between \( w = 8 \) and \( 12 \).*

**Example Nudge:**
*"Engineers use this trick to design PID controllers—they approximate nonlinear systems as
linear near a setpoint, just like you’re doing."*

*(After your response, we’ll dissect accuracy in Step 4.)*

=== Page 04 ===
**Your Response:** *Work through the Taylor terms and trade-offs. *

A: Assuming constant wind speed \( w = 10 \) mph for 5 seconds, we approximate \( B(w) \)
near \( w_O = 10 \) mph.

The Taylor expansion of \( B(w) \) around \( w_O \) is:

\

B(w) \approx B(10) + B'(10)(w — 10) + \frac{B''(10)H2Kw - 10)*2

\]

Physical Meaning of Terms:
\(.B(10) \):Base battery drain at 10 mph (e.g., 500 mAh/min).
\(B'(10) \):Rate of change in battery drain per mph (e.g., +50 mAh/min per mph > how

sensitive battery is to wind).
\(.B'(10) \):Curvature (e.g., diminishing returns at extreme winds).

Fit:The polynomial closely matches the true \( B(w) \) near \( w = 10 \) mph (green zone).
Divergence:At \( w < 5 \) mph or \( w > 15 \) mph, the true curve (exponential) deviates
sharply

**Step 4: Accuracy & Limitations (Structured Critique)**
*"You’ve built a precise local approximation—now let’s pressure—test it."*

### **Guided Analysis: **
1. **Error Estimation: **

— *"At \( w = 12 \, \text{mph} \), your Taylor polynomial predicts \( B(12) \approx 500 +
50(2) + \frac{B'(10)H2}(4) \). If the true \( B(12) = 620 \, \text{mAh/min} \), what’s the
absolute error? What % of the true value is this?"*

2. **Breakdown Threshold:**

— *"Your ‘green zone’ (8—12 mph) works because \( B"'(w) \) is small. At \( w = 15 \,
\text{mph} \), turbulence dominates. How would the *third derivative* \( B'''(10) \) warn
you?"* *(Hint: Think inflection points.)*

3. **Real—World Mitigations:**
— *"Engineers combine Taylor with *piecewise* approximations. Sketch how you’d stitch a

linear (1st-order) model for \( w < 5 \, \text{mph} \) to your quadratic model here."*

**Your Task:** *Calculate the error, interpret \( B'" \), and draft a piecewise solution.*

**Example Nudge:**

=== Page 05 ===
*"Like weather models using different equations for calm vs. stormy conditions, your drone
might switch models mid-flight—but with a cost (e.g., computational lag)."*

*(After your response, we’ll reflect on the deeper question.)*

**Your Response:** *Crunch the numbers and describe your piecewise fix.*

**Key Insight:** *Taylor’s power isn’t perfection—it’s strategic sacrifice. You traded global
accuracy for local simplicity, a hallmark of applied math.*

A: 1. Error Analysis at \( w = 15 \) mph:
Taylor Approximation (Quadratic):
\l
B(15) \approx B(10) + B'(10)(5) + \frac{B"(10)H2}(5)*2
\]
If \( B(10) = 500 \), \( B'(10) = 50 \), and \( B'"(10) = -2 \):
\l
B(15) \approx 500 + 50(5) + \frac{-2H2}25) = 725 \text{ mAh/min}
\]
True Exponential Model:
If the real behavior is \( B(w) = 400 e*{0.1w} \), then:
\l
B(15) \approx 400 e’{1.5} \approx 898 \text{ mAh/min}
\]
% Error:
\l
\frac{|898 — 725|H898} \times 100 \approx 19.3\%
\]

Marginally acceptable for short-term predictions, but risky for long flights.

2. Danger Zone (20% Error Threshold):
— Solve for \( w \) where \( |B_{\text{true}(w) — B_{\text{Taylor}Kw)| > 0.2 B_{\text{true}}(w)
\).
— Approximate Danger Zone:
— Beyond \( w > 15 \) mph or \( w < 5 \) mph (from graph trends).
3. Trade-Offs:
— Option (a) Add More Terms:
— Pro: Better accuracy over wider range.
— Con: More computation (drone’s processor may lag).
— Option (b) Shrink Operating Range:
— Pro: Simpler, reliable near 10 mph.
— Con: Useless in edge cases (e.g., sudden gusts).

=== Page 06 ===
— Choice:Shrink range to 9-11 mph* for this drone, since safety-critical systems prioritize
reliability over generality.

**Final Step: Reflection & Synthesis**

*"You’ve just navigated the core tension of applied mathematics: balancing accuracy with
practicality. Let’s crystallize the insights."*

### **Structured Debrief:**
1. **Taylor’s Strategic Role:**

— *"Your 19.3% error at 15 mph reveals a hard truth: Taylor approximations are* local tools.
*How would you explain this to an engineer insisting on ‘one model fits all’?"*

2. **Al’s Teaching Role:**
— *"| forced you to quantify error margins and defend trade-offs. How did this change your
view of approximations versus exact solutions?"*

3. **Meta—Learning:**
— *"Imagine teaching this to a peer. What’s the* one intuition *you’d emphasize about
Taylor series? (e.g., ‘They’re mathematical microscopes.’)"*

**Your Task:** *Answer each bullet above. Then, summarize your scenario’s key takeaway in
1 sentence.*

**Example Nudge:**
*"Like Newton approximating orbits with calculus (despite chaos), you’ve shown how
engineers tame complexity with strategic imperfection."*

**Your Final Response:** *Reflect on the questions above. *

**Signoff:**
*"This is where a human teacher would assign a follow-up challenge (e.g., coding your
piecewise model). For now, you’ve earned the Al equivalent of a coffee break."*
